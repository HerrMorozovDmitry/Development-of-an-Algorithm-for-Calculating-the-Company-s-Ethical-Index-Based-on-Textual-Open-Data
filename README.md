# Development-of-an-Algorithm-for-Calculating-the-Company-s-Ethical-Index-Based-on-Textual-Open-Data
Nowadays, when talking about any Company's Ethical Index most often means the principles of ESG (Environmental, Social, and Corporate Governance). However, the calculation of scores for this set of paradigms is done by many rating agencies, each of which may have its own methodology, most often requiring a long and time-consuming manual study of a large amount of reporting data for each company being evaluated. Hence, we faced the question of whether it is possible to sufficiently automate this process of rating companies according to their adherence to ESG-principles. For this purpose, we decided to reproduce the process of RAEX agency ESG-rating of Russian companies, using their open-text data, namely the data made publicly available on the websites of the companies themselves, as well as methods of machine learning.
